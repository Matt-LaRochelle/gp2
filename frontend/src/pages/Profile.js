            Hello Profile

            Before we do anything we need to set the color scheme better
            Create a practice journal
            Create a settings page - to edit the email/password
            Create a max bpm spot
            Create 3 secions - songs known, songs working, dream songs
        </div>
    )
}

export default Profile
